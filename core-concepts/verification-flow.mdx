# How Verification Works

An hConnect verification session has a clear lifecycle, from creation to completion.

### The Verification Lifecycle

A session can have one of the following statuses:

| Status           | Description                                                                                                     |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `initiated`      | The session has been created, and communication with the eID provider is starting.                              |
| `pending`        | Waiting for the user to take action (e.g., QR code displayed, awaiting redirect).                               |
| `authenticating` | (Optional) The user is actively authenticating in their eID app.                                                |
| `completed`      | The user has successfully completed the verification. User data is available in the `verifiedAttributes` field. |
| `failed`         | The verification failed (e.g., user rejection, incorrect credentials). Check the `error` field for details.     |
| `expired`        | The session expired because the user did not complete the action in time.                                       |
| `cancelled`      | The verification was cancelled by the developer (RP) or the user.                                               |

### Verification Flows

hConnect automatically selects the optimal flow based on the eID provider.

| Flow Type        | Description                                                                                     | Key eID Providers                   |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **QR Code (QR)** | The user scans a QR code on a web screen with their mobile eID app.                             | BankID SE, FrejaID, KMDL            |
| **Redirect**     | The user is redirected to the eID provider's authentication page and then back to your service. | MitID, Singpass, Most European eIDs |
| **Push**         | A push notification is sent to the user's device for them to approve the verification.          | Audkenni, Smart-ID, Evrotrust       |
