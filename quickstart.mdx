# Quickstart in 5 Minutes

Follow this guide to complete your first identity verification in under five minutes.

### Step 1: Get Your API Keys

To use the hConnect API, you need a `Client ID` and a `Client Secret`.

1.  Log in to the **[hConnect Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.hopae.com)**.
2.  Navigate to the **'Applications'** section and create a new app.
3.  From your app's detail page, copy the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`. Keep them secure, as they will be used for Basic Authentication in your API requests.

### Step 2: Create a Verification Session

Now, call the API to create a session to verify a user. We'll use Sweden's **BankID** as an example.

Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` with the values from Step 1.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="BankID SE (QR Flow)">
```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api-gw.hopae.com/v1/verifications \
  --user "YOUR_CLIENT_ID:YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "eid": "bankidse"
  }'
```

**âœ… Success Response:**
Convert the `flowDetails.qrData` into a QR code and display it to your user.
```json
{
  "verificationId": "ver_Abc123Def456",
  "status": "initiated",
  "eid": "bankidse",
  "flow": "qr",
  "flowDetails": {
    "qrData": "BASE64_ENCODED_QR_CODE_DATA"
  },
  "expiresAt": "2024-07-30T10:05:00.000Z"
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Evrotrust (Push Flow)">
Evrotrust sends a push notification to the user. `userData` is required to identify the user.

```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api-gw.hopae.com/v1/verifications \
  --user "YOUR_CLIENT_ID:YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "eid": "evrotrust",
    "userData": {
      "email": "user@example.com"
    }
  }'
```
**âœ… Success Response:**
The `flow` is `push`, indicating that a notification has been sent to the user's device.
```json
{
  "verificationId": "ver_...",
  "status": "initiated",
  "eid": "evrotrust",
  "flow": "push",
  "expiresAt": "..."
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Check the Verification Status

Periodically poll the API with the `verificationId` until the user completes the verification.

```bash cURL
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api-gw.hopae.com/v1/verifications/ver_Abc123Def456 \
  --user "YOUR_CLIENT_ID:YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
```

**âœ… Completed Response:**
The `status` will change to `completed`, and the `verifiedAttributes` field will contain the user's information.

```json
{
  "verificationId": "ver_Abc123Def456",
  "status": "completed",
  "eid": "bankidse",
  "verifiedAttributes": {
    "id": "pairwise-id-for-this-user",
    "provider_id": "198001011234",
    "given_name": "John",
    "family_name": "Doe",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "birthdate": "1980-01-01"
  },
  "verifiedAt": "2024-07-30T10:01:30.000Z"
}
```

<Note>
**Looking for the `authorizationCode`?**
For QR and Push flows, the `authorizationCode` is included in the response when the status becomes `completed`. You can then use this code with our **[Token API](/api-reference/token/create)** or follow the **[QR Flow Integration Guide](/guides/qr-flow)** to redirect the user.
</Note>

**Congratulations!** ðŸŽ‰ You've successfully completed your first identity verification.
